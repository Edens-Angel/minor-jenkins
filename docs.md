First step
Created a simple java project with a Person class where the person can have an name and a age.
The project also have 4 basic tests.

After this I downloaded Jenkins on my laptop. I have an mac so I used brew. But I prefer to work on my windows pc so I have downloaded Jenkins on my windows pc from home. I did this by going to the website and downloading the installer for windows.

After this I went to the localhost and started configuring what it asked me todo.
